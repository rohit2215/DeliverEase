# GitHub Pages Setup Guide

Your application has been deployed to the `gh-pages` branch, but you need to enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings.

## Steps to Enable GitHub Pages:

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**: https://github.com/rohit2215/DeliverEase

2. **Navigate to Settings**:
   - Click on the "Settings" tab in your repository

3. **Find Pages section**:
   - Scroll down to find "Pages" in the left sidebar
   - Or go directly to: https://github.com/rohit2215/DeliverEase/settings/pages

4. **Configure GitHub Pages**:
   - Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Under "Branch", select "gh-pages" from the dropdown
   - Under "Folder", leave it as "/ (root)"
   - Click "Save"

5. **Wait for deployment**:
   - GitHub will take a few minutes to build and deploy your site
   - You'll see a green checkmark when it's ready

6. **Access your site**:
   - Your site will be available at: https://rohit2215.github.io/DeliverEase

## Troubleshooting:

- If you don't see the "Pages" option, make sure you have admin access to the repository
- The gh-pages branch has been created and contains your built application
- Your backend is deployed on Vercel and the frontend is configured to use it

## Your Application URLs:

- **Frontend (GitHub Pages)**: https://rohit2215.github.io/DeliverEase
- **Backend (Vercel)**: https://deliver-ease-odg3-git-main-rohit-srivastavas-projects.vercel.app

Once you complete these steps, your application should be live and functional!
